### TODO:
- [ ] integrate the repo into astroid
- [ ] change config files to json
- [ ] fix hard coded scp files, and add separete dataset root in config
- [ ] separate output folder for each config
- [ ] implement debug mode in code, not from hardcoded separate dataset path

### This is the repository for multi-decoder DPRNN, submitted to ICASSP 2021. It deals with source separation with variable number of speakers. It has 98.5% accuracy in speaker number of selection and similar SNR as models trained individually on fixed number of speakers, which is much higher than all previous SOTA methods.

## We are still refactoring the codebase, and will provide another useful update soon. Demo can be found at: https://junzhejosephzhu.github.io/Multi-Decoder-DPRNN/
